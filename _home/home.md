A Browser securing your privacy. That's it.
================================  

The iridiumbrowser is based on the Chromium code base. All modifications enhance the privacy of the user and make sure that the latest and best secure technologies are used.
Automatic transmission of partial queries, keywords, metrics to central services is prevented and only occurs with the approval of the user. In addition, all our builds are reproducible and modifications are auditable, setting the project ahead of other secure browser providers.

Before iridiumbrowser, we had to decide if we wanted to have cutting edge technologies like sandboxed processes, WebRTC, WebUSB … , or if we wanted to use a browser that respects our privacy.
So we decided to use the power of free software and build a browser that can do both. We analysed the code of Chromium and stripped out the functionality which exposes data to others in a way we don‘t like. See most important changes <a style="color: #ffffff;" href="https://github.com/iridium-browser/iridium-browser/wiki/Differences-between-Iridium-and-Chromium#differences-between-iridium-and-chromium" target="_blank">here</a>     
Our ambition is to get builds for Debian, Ubuntu, openSUSE, fedora, Windows and OS-X a couple of days after a new release of Chromium. To achieve this, we need help from individuals and organisations, who have the same intention.
Currently there are weeks between a new release of Iridium and Chromium.     
Please take this into consideration for your personal usage of the browser as you might be at risk when surfing unknown and potentially dangerous websites!
