Finally, we are happy to announce that the latest Windows and Ubuntu/Debian builds solve the problem. 
The trouble with SSL certificate handling was quite a challenge for us. There was no security / privacy problem for the user, but the usability with many sites was poor. 
This is solved now.     
Due to these issues the next major version is delayed and we will jump straight to version 57.     
Stay tuned and private!
