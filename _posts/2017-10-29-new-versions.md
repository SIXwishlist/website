As some of you have already noticed with the lastest release, we have change the version numbers to a time stamp and all future builds will have the following format **YYYY.MM** e.g. **2017.10**.      
<!--break-->       
Latest builds are available for **Windows, macOS, openSUSE, Fedora, RHEL/CentOS**.
