Apologies for the silence!
We have been incredibly busy with our day jobs and therefore have not been able to work on version 59 as planned.
Chromium 59 was release in early June and if we would start patching and building now, it would almost take us till August and this is when Chromium will release version 60.

Therefore we have decided to skip on v59 and focus on **version 60.0** which we hope to release **in August**.

Stand-by and stay private!
